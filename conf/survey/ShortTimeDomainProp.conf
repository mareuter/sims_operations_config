#==========================================================================
#   The Simple SuperNova program uses a non-terminating observing 
#   schedule of user-defined sequences of observations. The user-defined
#   sequence is further refined into repeating cycles of observation visits.
#   The distribution of sequences is, optimally, uniform; the distribution of
#   cycles within a sequence is also uniform; however, the distribution of 
#   visits within a cycle need not be uniform.
#
#   Using the graphic below, consider a Sequence to be indicated by {}:
#      ..{}...{}...{}...
#
#   Consider a Cycle to be indicated by <>:
#       ..{<>..<>..<>}...{<>..<>..<>}...{<>..<>..<>}...
#       The number of cycles within a sequence is defined by "CycleRepeats".
#       The interval between consecutive cycles is "CycleInterval".
#
#   Consider a Visit to be indicated by |:
#       ..{<|..|...|.|>..<|..|...|.|>..<|..|...|.|>}...{<|..|...|.|>.. 
#       The number of visits per cycle is determined by the number 
#       of "VisitInterval" defined. "VisitInterval" defines the spacing
#       between visits.
#
#   For maximum flexibility, "SequenceDuration" is overloaded to mean:
#       when >0: overwrite CycleRepeats with the number of full cycles that 
#               fills the time specified in "SequenceDuration".
#       when = 0: make the system compute the effective Duration based on the
#           "CycleRepeats" value specified.
#
#   The filter choice used during the visits, depends on "SeqFilter" list.
#       The first listed is considered the primary filter which will be used
#       whenever the seeing meets the filter requirements. The additional 
#       filters are backup filters used when the primary filter is 
#       inappropriate.
#====================================================================
#   Priority Ranking Scheme across all Proposals
#
#   All proposals use the same ranking scale of values [0.0 : 1.0] .
#       Rank 0.0  indicates that, in the current context of the proposal, 
#           a Field should not be observed.
#       Rank 0.1 is a 'stand-by' rank indicating that the Field is ready to
#           be observed (butthere is no urgency).
#       Rank 0.5 indicates increasing urgency to observe the Field due to 
#           the Proposal's scheduling requirements. Few Fields at any moment
#           should have such a high priority.
#       Rank 1.0 indicates urgent need to observe the Field.  Failure to 
#           observe immediately will cause the current sequence to abort.
#====================================================================
#   Priority Ranking in Simple SuperNova Proposal
#
#   The proposal uses the closeness between the current Simulation Time
#       and the Next Event time as the primary ranking criteria for a Field.
#       A timing window is constructed from the time interval between 
#       the next Visit and the previous Visit. From that interval an urgency 
#       scale is created to the precision required.
#
#   The normalized time scale used is as follows:
#       normalizedT = (currentTime-nextVisitTime)/(nextVisitTime-lastVisitTime)
#
#   The priority ranking of an observing visit starts rising at "WindowStart";
#       it reaches a maximum value at "WindowMax"; and it is
#       abandoned at "WindowEnd" if it still hasn't been observed.
#   
#   Using defaults: WindowStart=-0.20, WindowMax=0.20; WindowEnd=4.0,
#       The priority begins rising at (0.2 * normalizedT) before the Visit time;
#       it reaches the maximum priority at (0.2 * normalizedT) after the event 
#       time; and returns to lowest prioirty at (0.4 * normalizedT) after 
#       the Visit time.  
#       Note: negative indicates *before* Visit time, positive is *after* Visit.
